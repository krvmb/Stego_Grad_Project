State:
	Significant compression, with the 1920x1080 image starting out with a size of 394,348, but after uploading and downloading the image, it maintained its resolution but has a size of 130,517.
	None of the 3 StegJpeg methods were successful.
		-swapdct was unable to even hide a message on fullHD-compressed image
		-lsbdct and -highdct are able to hide in the compressed image, but running -extract on an uploaded image produces an output with a different file size each time, although diff does not find any differences in them.
	Like Instagram, Visual distortion after StegJpeg hides message on fullHD-compressed image, but no visual distortion after upload
		No visual distortions after StegJpeg operates on Avatar and Background-sized compressed images
	To test:
		Reupload images to see if they continue to get compressed or changed
