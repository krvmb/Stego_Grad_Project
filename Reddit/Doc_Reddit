Avatar: Fails for 15360x8640, works for 5760x3840. Size decreases from 6,525,576 to 5,900,194 indicating further compression.
	Hiding 'Hello' with swapdct, lsb, and high increases size to 10,382,598
	Extraction
		Swap: No difference in Reddit processing when uploading the same image. -extract consistently extracts 102 bytes
		Lsb/High: Different extraction amounts each iteration, as well as when uploading the same image.

Post: Resolution limit unknown, tested up to 15360x8640
	StegJpg appears to exponentially increase size of files it hides images, given trying to hide 'Hello'
		394,348 -> 395,115
		6,525,576 -> 10,355,964
		12,536,589 -> 21,543,314
	Trying to -extract 'Hello' from the 16k file appears to break StegJpg for -swapdct, as it gives a 5MB file of Nul characters. Works for the 5k and below resolutions.
		StegJpg is able to -extract 'Hello' From the 16k file for -lsbdct and -highdct

State:
	The swap, lsb, and high functions that StegJpg implements appears to survive any processing that i.redd.it may do.
	Still need to analyze what changes, if any, Reddit does
	Potential to examine other image hosts reddit uses like imgur
	Did not test DM's

Method:
	Tested using default args for -swapdct, -lsbdct, -highdct
