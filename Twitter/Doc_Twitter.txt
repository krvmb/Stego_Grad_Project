	15360x8640 resized to 4096x2304
	5760x3840 resized to 4096x2731, appears that to resize max of 4096x4096
	Slight decrease in size of 1920x1080 image from 394,348 to 390,680
	Using the default -swap, -lsb, and -high args, StegJpg was able to survive any potential changes that Twitter does

Avatar:
	Full HD resized to 400x400
	Unable to Hide even 1 byte using -swap on a 400x400 image so did not test with Twitter
		Trying to extract results in a file full of NULL
	Size differences for rerunning -extract, but diff picks up only a single character difference
	Windows' Preview and MS Paint show clear distortion, but none visible after upload

Banner:
	Full HD resized to 1500x500
	Everything same as Avatar
	
State:
	Successful Stego on Twitter Posts, limited Avatar and Banner methods
	Of interest is why there is no visible distortion after uploads and subsequent download, but still successful extraction after downloads
		Twitter must be? processing images in some way for the distortion to not appear, but what
	Did not do DMs
